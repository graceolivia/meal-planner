This is a recipe organizer for my weekly recipes.

It will take in my recipes and give me a weekly meal plan.

The recipes will be in dict form, have tags, and be randomized.

Based off this reddit idea:

"My fiancee loves to cook for us but hates picking meals and making shopping lists. Now she and I get an email once a week with all of our meals for the coming week and the ingredients we need to buy.

Edit: For those asking for more information, it's actually really simple! My fiancee already had a list of recipes she likes to make, so no scraping involved. There's a dictionary with ingredients for each meal and a dictionary with a few categories for each meal ("chicken", "pasta", "crockpot", "salad", "chinese", etc.). Our meals for the past 4 weeks are saved in a text file. For each day of the week, a list of all meals that fit certain criteria is generated (haven't had that meal in the past two weeks, no back to back meals of same category, can't have same category more than a couple of times a week...) from which a random.choice is made, and the schedule and ingredients are emailed to us.

If we want to make any changes or try a new recipe, I just update it manually. I've been meaning to refactor as well as add a feature that will suggest new recipes for us, but I haven't gotten around to it. Let me know if you all have any suggestions or questions!"
